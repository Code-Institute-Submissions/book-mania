### Design and colors

#### Fonts:

I used **Gentium Book Basic**, from Google Fonts.


#### Colors:

* ![#8989bb](https://placehold.it/15/8989bb/000000?text=+) #8989bb - used for nav and footer

* ![#f1f1fd](https://placehold.it/15/f1f1fd/000000?text=+) #f1f1fd - background color

* ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) black - all the text on the body

* ![#FFFFFF](https://placehold.it/15/FFFFFF/000000?text=+) white - all the text on the nav and footer

* ![#3299ff](https://placehold.it/15/3299ff/000000?text=+) blue - used for buttons and hyperlink text

### Strategy

My goal in the design was to create a simple and intuitive interface to be able to easily access through the various pages of the site.

### Scope

This website is designed for all users who enjoy reading books. A portal in which it is possible to share the books read by attributing an rating and description.
The main purpose is to bring book lovers together in a virtual community where it is possible to discover new and interesting readings that, in case it is possible to buy.

### Wireframes

The following [wireframe](https://github.com/chris92vr/book-mania/tree/master/project-documentation/wireframes)  were created to design the project layout options for large, medium and mobile displays.


## Database

### Database Type

For this project I used  **MongoDB Atlas**.

My database consists of four collections, namely: book, categories, comment, users.

Book collection contains information about each book, person who added it and voting information. Categories collection represents the various genres that can be attributed to books. Comments collection contains comment text, username of person who added it, and id of the book about commented review. Users collection contains information about each user who signed up for the app. 

### Database Design

Picture below presents the database schema outlining structure of each collection and relationship between each collection.

![alt text](https://github.com/chris92vr/book-mania/blob/master/project-documentation/images/bookmaniadb.png "database-schema")

Relationships between collections are as follows:

- book and categories - one to one relationship as one record in book collection can be associated with one record in the categories collection;

- users and book - one to many relationship as one record in user collection can be associated with many records in the book collection;

- book and comment - one to many relationship as one record in book collection can be associated with many records in the comment collection.

- users and comment -  one to many relationship as one record in user collection can be associated with many records in the comment collection;


## Features

- [Flask-paginate](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-paginate/) - flask extension used to paginate reviews;

- [Flask-login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - flask extension used to handle the common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering usersâ€™ sessions;



### Database

- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - a fully-managed cloud database used to store manage and query datasets;

### Other

- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - Online tool was used to display the project on various devices;

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Software that was used to create wireframes;

- [DBDiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) - A relational database diagram design tool used to create database schema.

## Testing

### Code validation

In order to to check the validity of the website code, I have used the following:

    - HTML Validation: https://validator.w3.org/ - no errors identified.
    - CSS Validation: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ - Identified issues with materializecss not with my project.
    - PYTHON Validation: https://pep8online.com/ no errors identified.

### Responsiveness testing

Several tests were carried out to verify the correct functioning of the project with positive results.
The functionality of the site is optimal. Browser compatibility is verified for Firefox and Chrome on Windows 10 home; Firefox, Chrome on Ubuntu 19.10 and Firefox, Chome on Android 10. The responsiveness of the pages is suitable on desktop screens, tablets and mobile phones.
In the folder [project-documentation/testing](https://github.com/chris92vr/book-mania/blob/master/project-documentation/testing/ "testing"), there are screenshots named in the following format: (screen resolution) - Operating system (browser) - screen description.


## Deployment

### GitHub

The site was developed using Gitpod IDE. 

To initialize the local repository the command `$ git init` was used. After adding initial files and committing them `$ git remote add origin 'GitHub repo name'` command was used to add new remote repository. Code was then pushed to the master branch of the remote repository using `$ git push -u origin master`.

In order to track the changes in the local repository the following steps were taken:

- command `$ git add 'filename'` - to update what will be committed;

- command `$ git commit` - to commit the changes.

Using `$ git push` command all changes from the local repository were pushed to the remote one on GitHub.

### Heroku

This project is hosted using Heroku, deployed directly from the `master` branch. 

To deploy my project I followed these steps:

1. Create App: 

     - On Heroku website I logged onto my account and created [my app](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/bookmania1);
     - Under the **Settings** tab I clicked button **Reveal Config Vars** and I set the IP to 0.0.0.0 and the PORT to 5000;
     - At the later stage configuration for the MongoDB database were added, namely 'MONGO URI' and 'SECRET KEY';

2. Install the Heroku CLI: 

     - To install Heroku CLI I typed `$ sudo snap install --classic heroku` command into the terminal; 
     - In order to log in to the Heroku account I typed `$ heroku login` command into the terminal;

3. Git repository:

     - If repository not created already the following commands should be used in order to initialize a git repository in a new or existing directory: 
        ```
        $ cd 'directory-name'/
        $ git init
        $ heroku git:remote -a 'app-name''
        ```
        
    - For existing repositories add the Heroku remote should be used: `$ heroku git:remote -a 'app-name'`;

4. Requirements:

    - In order to run the app Heroku needs to install the required dependencies so make sure that 'requirements.txt' file was created and committed;
    - In order to create 'requirements.txt' file run `$ sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` command in the terminal;

5. Procfile:

    - Procfile is a Heroku specific type of file that tells Heroku how to run our project;
    - For the 'Procfile' run `$ echo web: python > Procfile` command in the terminal;
    - In order to start web processes run `heroku ps:scale web=1` command in the terminal;

5. Deployment: Committed code was deployed to Heroku using the following command: `$ git push heroku master`.
